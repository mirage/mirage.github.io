<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<h4 id="quality-and-test">Quality and Test</h4>

<p>We’ve had some recent issues with MirageOS website uptime (see
<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/issues/404">mirage/mirage-www#404</a> — the issue number is quite ironic).  Part of the
problem in debugging this is that we don’t have adequate log capturing yet. We
could put the site in auto-restart mode but it’s much better to know that it’s
down and work towards a fix (rather than relying too heavily on restarts).</p>

<p>One approach is to rewrite <code class="highlighter-rouge">xenconsoled</code> to have more flexibility to output
logs.  We could turn this into a <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects">Pioneer Project</a>. Mort can write up a
short paragraph and Anil/Dave/ThomasG can be mentor(s). There may even be
existing patches out there that we could try now but it’s actually quite
tricky to recompile these without crashing the machine. Any help from others
would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Another one of the required pieces is a reporter for logs.  ThomasL wrote one
and will send an email to the list with information on the issues he came
across.</p>

<h4 id="functoria">Functoria</h4>

<p>Jeremy has been looking over this carefully, comparing with things in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">mirage-dev</code>, and fixing some xen-related issues.  This is still ongoing and
it’s just a lot of little things that need cleaning up e.g. console connects
to xenstore, so it’s a little bit different. The unix aspects have been
checked over carefully but we’re also checking that the xen pieces are also ok.
Jeremy will try and post updates on how things are going.  The release gate
for Functoria might be when <code class="highlighter-rouge">mirage-www</code> runs with a dynamic block device
using functoria (that should stress everything).</p>

<p>JonL tried functoria stuff and had a few issues but it wasn’t clear if this
was due to functoria or some other issue with Opam.  Will delete <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.opam</code> and
try again. ThomasL also tried functoria and it worked well but on Qubes (his
primary OS), there were some issues as it makes assumptions.</p>

<h4 id="blog-posts">Blog posts</h4>

<p><strong>Charrua</strong> — There’s still a pending blog post which should be ready to merge.
The related code for <code class="highlighter-rouge">mirage-skeleton</code> has already been reviewed and merged
and the last step is to check the blog post one last time (it’s already been
reviewed by others).</p>

<p>Sidenote: At the moment no-one has had a chance to look at making a DHCP
client with Charrua. It would be good if someone could work towards this and
perhaps we could make it a <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects">Pioneer Project</a>, but it would likely be a
5-star one.</p>

<p><strong>Irmin update</strong> - There have been a lot of Irmin releases since the
<a href="https://mirage.io/blog/introducing-irmin">introductory blog post</a> and it would be good to get a follow up
post about the progress that’s been made.  Given the amount of work underway,
it’s not likely that ThomasG will be able to write this.  He’d like to explain
what the summer interns did and also document the language bindings that
exist — getting all this in one post would be quite lengthy.  He’ll try to
find some time to put thoughts down.  Perhaps we can encourage those who wrote
the language bindings to write things up.</p>

<p>Since there are likely to be a number of Irmin-related posts, we can set up a
short schedule of posts (as we’ve done before) — can aim to do this around
January or February.  There doesn’t need to be any big fanfare about this,
just a mechanism to help get the posts out.  For example, surfacing details on
how to upgrade from v0.9 to v0.10 would be a useful post.</p>

<p><strong>MirageOS end-of-year review</strong> — We’ve done this previously for <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/2014-in-review">2014</a> and
it was well received, so we should continue the pattern. We have a lot of
material to draw on, in terms of <a href="https://mirage.io/releases/">changelogs</a>, <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/">blog posts</a> and
these <a href="https://mirage.io/wiki/#Weeklycallsandreleasenotes">call notes</a>. Jeremy agreed to take a look at this and see what he can
start pulling together for others to look over.</p>

<p><strong>Unikernel.org</strong> — There’s also a new community site for unikernels as a
whole at <a href="http://unikernel.org">unikernel.org</a>. Having a short post here to introduce that would
be useful and Amir will put something together before the next call. Others
are welcome to discuss or comment via <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/issues/412">mirage-www#412</a>.</p>

<h4 id="mirageos-appvms-on-qubes">MirageOS AppVMs on Qubes</h4>

<p>ThomasL has been running some MirageOS VMs on <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org">Qubes OS</a> (which is his main
work environment). He’s working on a library to provide support for this
(<a href="https://github.com/talex5/mirage-qubes">talex5/mirage-qubes</a>), which does enough help the user do something useful.</p>

<p>ThomasL would like to implement a MirageOS firewall VM to replace the existing
firewall in Qubes OS.  In order to do this, he needs to implement netback
support. Dave has a branch somewhere that may help with that and will look at
merging it into a current repo.  Joanna (Qubes OS project lead), was also
asking on Twitter about running a GPG backend as a MirageOS unikernel. It
wasn’t clear how much additional work would be needed over the existing TLS
efforts.  Hannes pointed out that there could be quite a bit of work depending
on what exactly is required. Help is welcome and there’s a thread on the
mailing list — “<a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/archives/html/mirageos-devel/2015-11/msg00116.html">MirageOS AppVMs on Qubes</a>”</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rootkovska/status/672079159687053313"><img src="/graphics/qubes-tweet.png" alt="rootkovska's tweet about MirageOS and Qubes OS" /></a></p>

<h4 id="unikernel-size">Unikernel size</h4>

<p>There was a question on the list from Wassim about getting back to very small
unikernels.  Wassim is doing a project on MirageOS and running on a very low
memory budget (on x86). Hence any reduction will make a big impact on his use
case. The focus is a DHCP server on Xen and they need to reduce the size as
they’re linking it with other components. He was wondering what the runtime
size was for the MirageOS DNS app. It seems that used to be below 8MB but
trying to make it any smaller was tricky just due to how Xen.  Wassim would be
overjoyed if he can get his runtime size down to such levels.</p>

<p>Anil pointed out that the upcoming ‘flambda’ patch to the OCaml compiler will
improve things for all OCaml code. Perhaps we can look again at memory usage
when we do our DHCP server using Charrua. Making this runtime small is
important for MirageOS too as, we want to deploy to ARM devices.</p>

<p>Wassim will make an issue on the mirage/mirage issue tracker so that we follow
up with this.</p>

<h4 id="unikernel-hackathons">Unikernel hackathons</h4>

<p>We ended up discussing two separate types of events, a unikernel ‘install
party’ (like the Linux install parties of yore) and a longer MirageOS
hackathon/retreat/dev-meeting.</p>

<p><strong>Unikernel install party</strong> — There seems to be desire amongst people to
explore some of the other unikernel implementations that are available, e.g.
HaLVM, Rump Kernel, IncludeOS, etc.  However, getting started with any of
these can be non-trival as the getting the environment set up appropriately
takes prior knowledge.  We thought about arranging the equivalent of an
‘install party’ (perhaps a ‘Hello World!’ party?), so that people can get
going quickly with a number of different implementations.  We’d likely find
many ways to improve the onboarding experience for all the implementations.
Perhaps we could link this up with the London Unikernel Meetup?  Mid-February
might be a good time to do this as a one-day/evening event and we could set
the scope to be quite broad (and thus invite a lot more people).</p>

<p><strong>MirageOS hackathon</strong> — There is also desire to hold an OpenBSD-style
hackathon purely for MirageOS.  This would be an event over several days, with
the emphasis on writing code and working towards some goals (to be defined at
the beginning of the event).  Ideally, this would be held at some other
location where people would travel to.  This event could be arranged to take
place in March/April to give people enough time to plan.</p>

<p>Since both events are serving different needs, there’s no reason we couldn’t
do both. It’s mostly a matter of organising and ensuring that there would be
enough participants for both.</p>

<h4 id="pioneer-projects">Pioneer Projects</h4>

<p><strong>1 star projects</strong> — In the run up to the holidays, it would be great if we
can gather a few more 1-star Pioneer Projects.  This will help anyone who’s
thinking of getting started with MirageOS over the break, even if they don’t
contact anyone directly.  It would also be timely to review the star-ratings
for the current projects. On the next call, it would be good to review the
project list to see where things stand.</p>

<p><strong>Outreachy</strong> — One student will be working on NTP, which will have benefits
to a number of other projects.  Hannes is mentor and Mort can provide advice
on what he had to do as a mentor from last time — the reporting requirements
seem to be quite lightweight.</p>

<p><strong>Longer projects</strong> — There was also the suggestion of more ‘elastic’ projects.
These would be areas that start off easy and small but can expand and become
more substantive pieces of work (e.g. can last for 3 months). Performance
regression testing is one such area.  Projects like this would also help
onboard new contributors over an extended period.</p>

<p>–</p>

<h4 id="aob">AoB</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">vchan</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">conduit</code> — JonL can pick up <code class="highlighter-rouge">vchan</code> again. ThomasL is using it
for Qubes and Mindy has a number of uses for it. Wassim is also using it so
improvements are welcome (it’s a critical piece of their stack). Wassim’s aim
is to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">conduit</code> but docs are quite sparse and any links to more would be
useful. Anil has blog post somewhere that he can link to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next call is scheduled for <strong>Wednesday, 16th December</strong>. Please add any
<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Call-Agenda">agenda items</a> you wish to discuss in advance and refer to the
<a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mirageos-devel">mailing list</a> for actual details a day or so in advance.</p>
